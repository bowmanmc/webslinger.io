One of my goals for this year has been to level up my design skills.
I want to be able to put the same level of thought and craftsmanship
into my design decisions as I do on the development side of things.
One of the better resources for me so far has been
<a href="http://hackdesign.org">Hack Design</a>,
a design course over weekly emails.
</p>

Last week, after signing up, I recieved
[Lesson 0](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/0). It was pretty light on
meaty material, but introduced the weekly email format and suggested
watching [Objectified](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70114976?trkid=439131)
by Gary Hustwit. Since I had already seen it, along with the other two
films in the [Design Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Trilogy),
I had mostly forgotten about the course until a new lesson
showed up in my inbox this morning.

[Lesson 1](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/1) contains five links to articles
and resources covering the "What is Design?" topic. These hit the points
you would expect for a first lesson, such as
[Dieter Rams Ten Principles for Good Design](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design)
and an
[Indroduction to Interaction Design](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-interaction-design/),
but also a
[great article by P.J. Onori](http://somerandomdude.com/2012/01/10/transition-from-development-to-design/)
on how he transitioned from a developer to a designer. Each of the articles
in the lesson has been a spring board for finding even more great
content and design resources. One of my favorites so far has been the
[Creative Mornings](http://creativemornings.com/) website. It has
a [vast archive](http://creativemornings.com/talks) of short talks on a
huge variety of topics. I'll have more than enough content to keep me busy
until next week's lesson.

[Hack Design](http://hackdesign.org) has fifty lessons listed on their website,
perfect for helping me hit my goal of becoming a better designer this year.
