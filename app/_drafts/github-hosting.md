excerpt: "Did you know you can host static pages on GitHub for free? With a
          little bit of configuration, you can even host them while using
          your own domain name. In this post, I'll show you how to set it all up."

<p class="typl8-drop-cap">
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is an awesome resource for developers.
Besides providing a safe, secure, organized place to store the source code for
your projects, it also has a way publish static files to the web.
I use it for this site, and in this post, I'll show you how to set it up.

The first step is to create a github account and repository. GitHub has
the best step-by-step instructions on how to do this. Go to their
[help site](https://help.github.com)
and follow the
[Setup Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and
[Create a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo) guides.
Once you have a repository created and checked out on your local machine, you'll
use a feature called
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages).
This feature of GitHub will automatically publish anything checked into a
specailly named branch (gh-pages) to a url corresponding to your project name.
