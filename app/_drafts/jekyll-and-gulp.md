Having a tight feedback loop is an absolute must for modern, front-end, web
development. Being able to make a change to a source file, and immediately
see the effect in the browsers running on your desktop and mobile devices is

<a href="http://webslinger.io">WebSlinger.io</a> and show you the source code so you can
utilize these tools on sites of your own.
