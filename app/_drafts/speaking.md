In the last year, I've been able to speak at a total of six events, giving
two different talks. Three of those were local events here in Dayton, while
three of those required travel out of state (Chicago, San Francisco, and
Philadelphia). It was a lot of work, but also a a lot of fun and very rewarding.
Here's why I think you should do it too.

A few years ago, I read a blog article about how speaking at a conferences
is a good way to spur networking and start conversations with strangers.
This seemed a bit counter-intuitive to me at first, but I think this is
the number one thing I've gotten out of speaking at conferences. I'm a
bit of an introvert and can be kind of awkward striking up conversations
with strangers. Being on the speaker list gives people an excuse to seek
you out at a conference and gives you something specific to talk to
people about.

One thing I learned quickly is to tailor your talk to your audience. Both
of my talks were dealing with making web maps with D3.js. This turns out
to be a really broad topic. When I gave the talk at the Geo conferences,
audience questions tended to be less about the mapping aspects and more
about the JavaScript conventions and setup I had used. On the other hand,
when I gave the talk at Web Developer conferences, questions tended to be
more about the mapping aspects of it.
