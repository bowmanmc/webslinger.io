Howdy! My name is Michael Bowman and I like to build websites and make maps.

I work at [Applied Information Sciences](http://appliedis.com/careers) and we
are always looking for passionate web developers and data visualization
experts. If you're interested, please
send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowmanmc) or apply
through the [AIS Careers Page](http://appliedis.com/careers).

I teach Web Development and Computer Science courses at
[Sinclair Community College](http://sinclair.edu) part time. It's been such
a great experience helping so many people get started on their career
in Computer Science, and I'm extremely proud to be a part of such a great
organization.

I also organize the
[Dayton Data Visualization Meetup](http://meetup.com/daytondv),
where we gather local experts in the data visualization field quarterly and
share ideas on tools and techniques. We always have an excellent turnout
and it's been awesome meeting so many people in the Dayton area working
on such cool stuff! It's free to join and a great way to spend a lunch
break. I hope to see you there!

Did I mention that I love
[speaking at conferences and meetups](/speaking)? Please contact me via
[twitter](https://twitter.com/webslingerm) or
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowmanmc)
if you're interested in having me talk about D3.js or web maps at your next event.
